# Paul's CS 31 projects

## What am I looking at?

Grading results (particularly failed test cases) for a project can be found in `ðŸ—¿.txt`. If no test cases were failed, the file will only contain "ðŸ¤©".

All other files in a project directory are part of my submission for that assignment.

## But why am I looking?

You tell me!

In all seriousness, I'm publishing my code so I can learn how to use Git. I know I could make this a private repository, but it's more fun and exciting to risk committing public mistakes. (However, I'm fairly confident nobody will see this repo. On the off chance you're not me, hihi~~ ðŸ˜˜.)
